# Cursor Rules

This folder contains Cursor IDE rules that optimize AI behavior for code analysis and development.

## Purpose

The `engineering-rule.mdc` file configures Cursor AI to act as a **Senior Principal Engineer** with:

- **Quality-focused approach**: Prioritizes thorough analysis and well-thought-out solutions over quick fixes
- **Context awareness**: Automatically checks the `.cursor/onboarding-docs` folder for existing analysis results before starting work
- **Best practices**: Follows SOLID principles, maintains consistency with existing code patterns, and considers long-term maintainability

## Installation

Copy this entire `rules` folder to your project's `.cursor` folder:

```bash
cp -r rules /path/to/your/project/.cursor/rules
```

Or on Windows:

```powershell
Copy-Item -Path rules -Destination .cursor\rules -Recurse
```

## How It Works

When placed in `.cursor/rules/`, Cursor automatically applies these rules to all AI interactions in your project. The AI will:

1. **Think before acting** - Take time to analyze problems thoroughly
2. **Prioritize quality** - Focus on maintainable, well-architected solutions
3. **Leverage analysis** - Check `.cursor/onboarding-docs/` folder for existing documentation before starting work

This works seamlessly with the Cursor Onboarding Suite, ensuring the AI uses the comprehensive analysis results generated by the onboarding commands.

## Benefits

- **Consistent AI behavior** across your entire team
- **Better code quality** through quality-focused guidance
- **Faster development** by leveraging existing analysis documentation
- **Reduced context switching** as the AI automatically references project documentation
